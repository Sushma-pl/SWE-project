# Research lab management system 
Research Lab Management System (RLMS) is a website intended to feature all lab-related information at one place, including lab members, research work, upcoming events, awards, and publications. Additionally, lab members should be able to modify the information presented on the website.
This project is part of CS4433 course. We are Team-4.
